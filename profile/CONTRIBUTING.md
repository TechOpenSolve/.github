## How to Contribute

### 1.  Identify an Issue

Start by exploring the repositories within TechOpenSolve to identify issues that resonate with you. Issues represent real-life challenges faced by individuals in the tech industry. If the issue exists you can move on to step [4](#4-contributing). If the issue does not exist continue with steps 2 and 3.

### 2. Open a Discussion

### 3. Document the Issue

Once an issue is accepted, document it with clear descriptions and relevant details. Be sure to provide context and examples to help others understand the problem.

## 4. Contributing

The purpose of TechOpenSolve is to recognize and highlight real-life contributions - tangible actions that genuinely work towards improving the tech industry. We focus on addressing real-world challenges by encouraging and acknowledging efforts that foster a more inclusive, supportive, and innovative environment. Through collective action, we aim to drive meaningful change in the tech community.

### Step 1: Identify a **Real Life** Contribution

1. This can be done either by recognizing an existing real-life contribution made by others, or by making a meaningful impact yourself. Here are just a few possible suggestions to help you get started: 

- Implementing practical solutions in real-life scenarios.
- Providing jobs, support, guidance, or resources to individuals or groups affected by the issue.
- Writing blog posts, creating videos, or other ways of advocating for change within organizations or communities.
- Collaborating with others to brainstorm and implement innovative approaches that bring a positive impact.

Of course there are many more options for making contributions. Feel free to explore other ways to contribute and make a difference in addressing real-life challenges within the tech industry.

2. After choosing an existing contribution or completing your real life contribution, use the 
[Contribution Acknowledgement Template](#step-2-recognize-contributions) to document your contribution by leaving a comment.

## Step 2: Recognize Contributions

Document the selected real life contribution/s:

To acknowledge and give credit to individuals, companies, or organizations that have positively contributed with helpful actions that aid the process of addressing an issue, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the relevant repository and then to the issue topic where the contribution occurred.

```
Replace the placeholders (e.g., [Name/Username], [Description of the contribution], [Link], [Additional Details]) with the appropriate information.

3. Ensure that the comment provides clear and detailed recognition of the contribution, including any relevant links or resources.

### 5. Fact Checking

Every contribution acknowledgment (comment) will undergo a thorough fact-checking process. During this process, we verify the authenticity of the contribution and ensure that it aligns with the values and goals of TechOpenSolve. Only comments that are confirmed to be genuine and significant will be retained. Any comments that fail to meet these standards will be removed to maintain the integrity and quality of the contributions recognized by the project.

### 6. Pull Requests

There are NO Pull Requests in this project! If you're confused about how TechOpenSolve operates, let me clarify: we tackle real-life issues in a manner similar to digital issues, but we do not use pull requests. Instead, recognized contributions are featured on the main website, automatically populated via the GitHub API. Itâ€™s crucial that comments comply with the CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines. Unauthorized comments will be deleted for non-compliance.
